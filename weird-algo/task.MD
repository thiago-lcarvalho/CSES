Consider an algorithm that takes as input a positive integer N. If N is even, the algorithm divides it by two, and if N is odd, the algorithm multiplies it by three and adds one. The algorithm repeats this, until N is one. For example, the sequence for N3n=3 is as follows:3→10→5→16→8→4→2→13→10→5→16→8→4→2→1Your task is to simulate the execution of the algorithm for a given value of N.

# Input

The only input line contains an integer N.

# Output

Print a line that contains all values of N during the algorithm.

# Constraints

- 1≤N≤1061≤n≤106

# Example

Input:

3

Output:

3 10 5 16 8 4 2 1
